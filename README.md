## Adding New Counties

Adding a new county is now much simpler:

1. Create two JSON files following the naming convention:
   - `{county}_{state}_payment_standards_2025.json` - Payment standards
   - `{county}_{state}_utility_allowance_2025.json` - Utility allowances
2. Upload the files to the root directory
3. The calculator will automatically detect the new county and add it to the dropdown menus

No code changes are required for adding new counties. The system automatically detects all available counties from the JSON filenames.

## Data Format

### Payment Standards JSON

Payment standards should be structured with zip codes as the top-level keys, and each zip code containing bedroom counts as keys:

```json
{
  "44017": {
    "0": 1068.0,
    "1": 1212.0,
    "2": 1464.0,
    "3": 1884.0,
    "4": 2016.0
  },
  "44022": {
    "0": 1440.0,
    "1": 1620.0,
    ...
  }
}
```

### Utility Allowance JSON

The calculator supports multiple utility allowance formats:

#### Simple Format (Montgomery style)
```json
{
  "heating": {
    "0": 23,
    "1": 27,
    "2": 33,
    "3": 37,
    "4": 44
  },
  "cooking": {
    "0": 10,
    "1": 11,
    ...
  }
}
```

#### Complex Format (Cuyahoga style)
```json
{
  "SPACE HEAT (natural gas)": {
    "1 Single-family dwelling": [
      56, 58, 60, 62, 64, 66, 68, 70, 72
    ],
    ...
  },
  ...
}
```

The calculator detects and handles both formats automatically.

## Notes

- The universal calculator automatically loads data when a county is selected
- The calculator provides a recommended RFTA rent amount, which is the maximum possible rent that would be approved
- County and state information is parsed from JSON filenames, so naming is important
